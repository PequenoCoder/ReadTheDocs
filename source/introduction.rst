Introduction
============

Welcome to the OpenExo Documentation! This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to our open-source platform, designed to facilitate numerical computation, data acquisition, and control for lower-limb robotic prostheses.

Our project focuses on enhancing mobility and function for individuals with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal disabilities. Through a combination of laboratory experiments, musculoskeletal modeling, and simulation, we strive to understand the underlying mechanisms of movement disorders. The insights gained from these studies directly inform the design and refinement of our innovative wearable robotic devices.

Key topics covered in this documentation include:

- **Project Overview:** An introduction to our mission and the challenges we address.
- **Installation:** Step-by-step guidance to set up the software and hardware components.
- **Usage:** Detailed instructions and examples on how to use our platform effectively.
- **Contribution Guidelines:** How to get involved and contribute to the project.

Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or practitioner, we hope this resource helps you explore and contribute to advancing wearable robotics and rehabilitation technologies.

Happy exploring!
